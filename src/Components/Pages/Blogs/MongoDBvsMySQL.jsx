                Databases are at the core of every application, serving as the foundation for data storage and retrieval. In the world of databases, two names frequently come up: MongoDB and MySQL.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                While both are database management systems, MongoDB and MySQL have distinct differences, making each more suitable for specific use cases. In this article, we'll delve into these differences.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">Data Model</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MySQL follows the traditional relational database model. It organizes data into tables with predefined schemas. Data is stored in rows and columns, making it ideal for structured data.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                On the other hand, MongoDB is a NoSQL database. It employs a document-oriented data model where data is stored in JSON-like documents. This schema-less design allows for flexibility and accommodates semi-structured or unstructured data.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">Query Language</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data. SQL is a powerful and widely adopted language for database operations, especially in the context of structured data.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MongoDB, on the other hand, uses a query language specific to document databases. It allows for complex querying, including the use of JavaScript expressions and object-based queries.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">Scalability</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MySQL can be scaled vertically by adding more resources to a single server. However, horizontal scaling (across multiple servers) can be more complex and requires specific configurations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling. It supports sharding, allowing data to be distributed across multiple servers, making it highly scalable for large datasets and high traffic applications.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">Use Cases</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MySQL is often chosen for applications that require strong data consistency, such as financial applications and applications that rely on complex transactions. It's also well-suited for relational data.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                MongoDB is preferred for projects that deal with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as content management systems, real-time analytics, and projects with evolving requirements.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">Conclusion</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                The choice between MongoDB and MySQL largely depends on your specific project requirements. Each database system has its own strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different use cases. Understanding these differences is key to making the right choice for your application.
